**FULL BRIEF**

**MVP - the must haves**

We chose to create educational content about Christmas around the world; fictitiously commissioned by the BBC. As a key feature, our web app centres around an interactive world map. 

1. **Map**: Users will be able to select a country from the map and see some key facts about Christmas in that country. The prototype will include a limited selection of countries, including at least one from each continent. When you click on the country, you will see these key facts: 
    - How to say Merry Christmas
    - Main Day Celebrated On
    - Christmas Meal
2. **Quiz** - To maintain educational purpose, the user will be able to click on a button that takes them to a quiz, to test their learning from the Christmas app
3. **Joke** - For some entertaining festive spirit, the user will be able to click on a button that reveals a random Christmas joke
4. **Design** - BBC Theme, Christmas Colour Palette, Well Rounded Design (as a minimum) for the MVP.

**Extensions - the should haves / could haves**

- Search Bar - To help users who don’t know the location of a particular country, the app will include a search bar
- Joke/Fact - add a fact into the jokes area, and make it like pulling a Christmas cracker that has a joke on one side and a random fact on the other
- Extra Design - Interactivity with buttons, enhanced versions of the MVP:
    - Loading Screen - Sleigh
    - Custom Pins on Map - candy canes
- Blog Content
    - Ability to scale the level of content with further information in mind (Without intruding on the user experience)
